# Aster-Void

## High Concept
Asteroids with gravity! And no gun!

## Genre
Arcade.

## Platform
Web for desktop.

## Story
You are the pilot of a rescue vehicle in space who must pick up free-floating astronauts who are drifting helplessly in an asteroid field.
## Aesthetics
Bright, flat colors and round shapes

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
Gravitar-esque physics-based controls. You must rotate and thrust your ship carefully to avoid colliding with asteroids. Flying over an astronaut saves them and adds to your score.

### Controls
- keyboard:
  - A/D or </> to rotate ship
  - W or ^ to thrust
  - "p/P" for pause

  
### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
On-screen instructions at the beginning of a play session. Game won't start until the player "takes off," requiring they at least know how to accelerate.
 
### Player Learning
Trial-and-error slowly improves players' skills from game to game.
