# Aster-Void

## High Concept
Asteroids with gravity! And no gun!

## Genre
Arcade.

## Platform
Web for desktop.

## Story
You are the pilot of a rescue vehicle in space who must pick up free-floating astronauts who are drifting helplessly in an asteroid field.
## Aesthetics
Bright, flat colors and round shapes

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
Gravitar-esque physics-based controls. You must rotate and thrust your ship carefully to avoid colliding with asteroids. Flying over an astronaut saves them and adds to your score. This follows in the tradition of similar space games going all the way back to the beginning of videogames themselves, but rearranges mechanics that spanned over numerous games. Aster-Void takes the gravity (but not the fuel) from Gravitar and the asteroids (sans destructability) from Asteroids. It also introduces another familiar mechanic from old arcade games, rescuing, and brings it to space. Not that there haven't been rescue mechanics in space games, but the sorts of space games from which Aster-Void draws inspiration certainly didn't feature them as a common staple. In a way though, the free-floating astronauts aren't much more than a glorified version of the dots from Snake. Whatever. Oh and there's a timer and a point system that I haven't thought out yet.

### Controls
- keyboard:
  - A/D or </> to rotate ship
  - W or ^ to thrust
  - "p/P" for pause

  
### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
On-screen instructions at the beginning of a play session. Game won't start until the player "takes off," requiring they at least know how to accelerate. The limited number of controls makes it quicker for players to situate themselves in the experience. Just one glance at the beginning of a round should be enough to get a general grasp, and the introductory take-off sequence provides a chance to test out all the buttons before the action comes on.
 
### Player Learning
Trial-and-error slowly improves players' skills from game to game. Every minute spent playing is spent getting more accustomed to the physics, the speed of turning the rocket, the acceleration of the thrust, and the general behaviors of the astronauts and asteroids. Unique strategies may be formed by different kinds of players. One could prioritize speeding before an obstacle arrives or even waiting for the coast to be completely clear.

## Other
The game will feature a procedurally generated twinkling-star space background. I'll try and make it all look as good as I can for a space background.

## About the developer
I'm Sam Finston! I'm a second year game design and development student. I program, make art in Illustrator, and do some writing on the side. I consider myself something of avideogame enthusiast, with my interests mainly being in old and indie games. I wear a bolo tie everyday and chirp like a bird.
